CLARITY: The title of the plot is confusing because it makes it sound like multiple ride types will be shown in the plot, but really only one ride type is being presented. The 'swipe no.' label is also a little confusing because it could be interpreted as a swipe id number. Saying 'number of swipes' would be easier to understand. Also what is the significance of 1.4e7 swipes?

ESTHETIC: I think the color scheme and symbology is clear and easy to differeniate, however the dark blue dots may not be necessary to convey the same amount of information.

HONESTY: There aren't any apparent distortions; the data presentation seems honest.

CLARITY: The plot needs a title and a legend explaining the color scheme. The clustering of the data makes it difficult to identify trends, especially in the 3D perspective.

ESTHETIC: The colors are easy to differeniate and the labeling of axes is clear.

HONESTY: There aren't any deliberate distortions, however, the 3D scale makes it very difficult to match the points up with their respective axis values. This makes it easy to misinterpret the data.

I think a 2D scatter plot of gross square feet vs. land square feet would be better. The number of residential units could still be shown on the same plot using a color gradient for the data points.

# PUI2015_hbk254_hw2

I collaborated on the first part of the assignment (show_bus_locations.py) with Alexis Soto-Colorado and Alejandro Rey Porcel. I contributed to the code for downloading of the json file and the code that numbers each of the buses in the output.

The second part of the assignment (get_bus_info.py) I did on my own.
